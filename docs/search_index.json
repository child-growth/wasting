While other cohort data from the Kenaba area show that children tend to experience decreased LAZ after birth, in the MRC Kenaba data used in this analysis, we see a high birth LAZ (approximately 0) and a rapid drop in LAZ in followup measurements (approximately -1 at one month). we see that the at birth measurements LAZ is ~0, and then for the follow-up measurements after the mean LAZ is ~ -1 (and the mean LAZ of just the subsequent follow-up visit at one month is ~ -1). We calculated 30% of measurements taken within two weeks of birth are lower than the at birth measurement beyond the technical error of measurement, and so are unrealistic decreases in child length, and 43% of follow-up measurements within two weeks of birth are less than the at-birth measurement by any amount. 5.2 Mean WLZ by region 5.3 Age-specific prevalence 5.4 Age-specific incidence 5.5 Age-specific incidence rate 5.6 Age-specific recovery 5.7 Age-specific prevalence of severe wasting 5.8 Age-specific longitudinal prevalence of persistent wasting 5.9 Age-specific prevalence of concurrent wasting and stunting 5.10 Age-specific prevalence of underweight (weight-for-age Z-score &lt; -2) "],["muac.html", "Chapter 6 Sensitivity analysis comparing wasting defined via weight-for-length versus middle-upper arm circumference 6.1 Overview", " Chapter 6 Sensitivity analysis comparing wasting defined via weight-for-length versus middle-upper arm circumference 6.1 Overview Purpose: Interpretation: Implications: MUAC was only measured in a subset of cohorts.
